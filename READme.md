Welcome to the Data Analysis and Visualization repository! 

This repository contains two statistical reports utilizing SPSS and Power BI.

## **SPSS Projects**
1. **Hypothesis Test on Player Stats**: This report indicates the hypothesis of a player scoring a certain amount under the given circumstances.

The SPSS reports were written as a part of my bachelor's level statistics course.
